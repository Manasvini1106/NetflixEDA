# NetflixEDA

This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of the Netflix titles dataset, uncovering valuable insights to support data-driven decision-making for content acquisition and recommendation strategies.

## Project Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed exploratory data analysis on the 4MB Netflix titles dataset using R. Cleaned and preprocessed the data by removing duplicates, handling null values, and dropping unnecessary columns, resulting in a refined 1MB dataset for efficient analysis.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Conducted a comprehensive analysis on the cleaned dataset, employing R and Tableau for data manipulation and visualization. Key analyses included:
   - Distribution of content types (movies and TV shows)
   - Rating patterns across genres
   - Country-wise production statistics filtered by rating categories

3. **Visualizations and Reporting**: Created insightful visualizations using Tableau to showcase the findings, including the content distribution across 190+ countries. Delivered a detailed report highlighting the analysis findings and visualizations, enabling data-driven decision-making for Netflix's content acquisition and recommendation strategies tailored to specific markets and viewer preferences.

## Dataset

The Netflix titles dataset used in this project contains information about movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform. The initial dataset size was 4MB, which was reduced to 1MB after cleaning and preprocessing.

## Tools and Technologies

- R: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
- Tableau: Employed for advanced data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

## Results and Insights

The analysis and visualizations provided valuable insights into the Netflix content distribution, rating patterns, and country-wise production statistics. Key findings include:

- Distribution of content types: Over 5,000 movies and 2,000 TV shows available on the platform.
- Rating patterns across genres: Identified genres with higher or lower average ratings, enabling targeted content curation.
- Country-wise production statistics: Uncovered the top countries contributing to Netflix's content library, filtered by rating categories.

These insights can help Netflix make informed decisions regarding content acquisition, personalized recommendations, and targeted marketing strategies based on viewer preferences and regional trends.

## Future Work

Potential areas for future work include:

- Incorporating user data and preferences to enhance personalized recommendations.
- Analyzing the impact of content availability on viewer engagement and retention.
- Exploring machine learning techniques for content recommendation and rating prediction.
